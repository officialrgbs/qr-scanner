## 📌 Background

Attendance plays a vital role in monitoring student performance, safety, and discipline. In traditional school settings, teachers manually check attendance at the beginning of each class, which is time-consuming, prone to error, and lacks transparency.

To address these issues, this project introduces a **QR Code-Based Attendance System**. Each student has a unique QR code containing their information. Upon arriving at school, they scan the QR code using a camera-based scanner (or mobile device). The system logs their presence in Firebase and notifies teachers and parents in real time through a connected dashboard or notification system.

By leveraging modern technology, we can make attendance:
- **Faster**
- **More accurate**
- **More secure**
- **Easier to monitor**
